## Useful links

These are some useful links that can become handy as you explore deeper each of the topics discussed during the course.

* [Cell Biology by the numbers](book.bionumbers.org). This is the online version of “Cell Biology by the Numbers”, a resource that you will find helpful both for understanding the data that characterizes modern biology and for how to construct order-of-magnitude estimates to understand that data.

* [BE/APh 161 : Physical Biology of the Cell (Caltech)](http://beaph161.caltech.edu/2018/).  This website contains the material used for teaching a 10 week version of the same course. Here you will find useful problem sets to flex those quantitative biology muscles.

* [Stat 110: Probability (Harvard)](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home).  This excellent course by Joe Blitzstein is a great resource to learn probability theory.

* [Video about dating humans and chimpanzees divergence](https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/allan-wilson-evolutionary-2008). This great video talks about how Allan Wilson used molecules to date the divergence between humans and chimpanzees.
